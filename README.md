# excel-openfda-api
Purpose: Demonstrate openFDA API usage within the VBA framework


This is an example of how to use the FDA's openFDA API. More information on the API is detailed here: https://open.fda.gov/


The current file has two main subs:
- `Sub openSearchForm()` Opens the userform for the NDC directory
- `Sub resetSheet()` Resets the formatting and clears the active sheet


The openSearchForm is an exact replica of the NDC directory tool found here: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/index.cfm
